# Graduation-project
our graduation project is called IMRI Scan (intelligent magnetic resonance imaging scan)

it's not for commercial use

we make desktop application to deploy the model

Done by:

***Mohammed Adry Ahmed (Deep learning enginnering)***

***Mohammed Abd-Elnaby Abd-Elwahab (system analysis)***

***Mohammed Mustafa Megahd El-Ewasy (desktop application developer)***

***Muhammad Tarek Refaat(Deep learning enginnering)***



**we diagnosis 3 type of injuries :**

1- anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)

2-abnormality

3-meniscus

Each type of injuries is binary classification

we build three models with the same architecture but different in the labels 

**this the results after training procedure:**
